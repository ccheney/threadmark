Threadmark is a Chrome extension designed for power users of ChatGPT. It allows you to highlight, bookmark, and organize specific snippets of text within your ChatGPT conversations, creating a local "clipbook" of your most valuable AI interactions.

## 📖 Overview

ChatGPT conversations can become long and unwieldy. Finding that *one* specific code snippet or explanation from three weeks ago often involves scrolling endlessly or relying on imprecise browser history.

**Threadmark solves this by letting you:**
1.  **Capture:** Highlight any text in a ChatGPT conversation and save it with a single click.
2.  **Annotate:** Add tags and notes to your bookmarks.
3.  **Re-anchor:** Click a bookmark to instantly open the original chat and scroll to the exact position of the text, even if the chat uses lazy-loading.
4.  **Review:** Browse and search your clipbook via a dedicated Side Panel.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Zero-Friction Capture:** Select text -> Click Bookmark.
*   **Robust Anchoring:** Uses fuzzy matching and DOM anchoring to find your text even if the chat content has shifted slightly.
*   **Local-First:** All data is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. No data is sent to external servers.
*   **Side Panel Manager:** robust search and filtering capabilities right alongside your chat.
*   **Privacy Focused:** Minimal permissions, works only on `chatgpt.com`.
